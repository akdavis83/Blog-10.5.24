        <div class="blog-slider__text">Condemnation and attacks will come whether we do the right thing or the wrong thing. Condemnation and attacks will come regardless of whether you believe in Christ or not. It is not possible to control everything that happens to us but even still we must take responsibility to the best of our ability for the situations we find ourselves in. In Christ we are made clean, there is no more condemnation in Him but having been washed we must only wash our feet and take care of our daily walk with the Lord. It is not the external things happening that determine our spiritual state, it is our response, our thoughts, words and actions. Defilement comes from within, purity, virtue and holiness comes from Christ and obedience to His word.</div>

        <div class="blog-slider__text">(Mark 7:18-23) And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</div>
